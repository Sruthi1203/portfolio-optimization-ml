# Portfolio Optimization with Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the *Financial Data Science* course (DATA 690). It explores advanced portfolio optimization techniques that go beyond Modern Portfolio Theory by integrating:

- Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
- Unsupervised Learning (KMeans Clustering)
- Monte Carlo Simulation
- Hybrid Optimization Strategies

##  Dataset
- 30 major U.S. stocks across six sectors (2018–2023)
- Data source: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)

##  Techniques Used
- ARIMA for return and risk forecasting
- KMeans to identify stock clusters based on volatility and returns
- Monte Carlo to simulate portfolio outcomes
- Scipy optimization for maximizing Sharpe Ratio
- Risk-adjusted return analysis and efficient frontier comparison

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- `yfinance`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `scipy`

##  Results
- Built diversified portfolios optimized under different scenarios
- Compared traditional vs machine-learning-based strategies
- Generated performance metrics: Sharpe ratio, standard deviation, expected return

##  Folder Contents
- `Data_690_final_project.ipynb`: Full analysis and implementation
- `figures/`: Key charts and visualization outputs
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages
